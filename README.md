This repository contains an example of an intermittent NullPointerException in ActionScript 3. The bug is caused by accessing a property of an object that might be null. The solution demonstrates how to use null checks to prevent the exception.

The `bug.as` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides the corrected code with null checks.
