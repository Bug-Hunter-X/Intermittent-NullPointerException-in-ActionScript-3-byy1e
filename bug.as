The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that is null:

```actionscript
var myObject:MyObject = someMethodThatMightReturnNull();
trace(myObject.someProperty);
```

If `someMethodThatMightReturnNull()` returns `null`, attempting to access `myObject.someProperty` will throw a `NullPointerException`.  This is a common error, but the challenge is that the error might not always be reproducible because of the unpredictable nature of `someMethodThatMightReturnNull()`. It might return a valid object most of the time, leading to intermittent crashes.
